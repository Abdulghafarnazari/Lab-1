// PART A & B — Student class 
// Note: Part A and Part B both use a class named "Student".
// In PHP we cannot create two classes with the same name in one file,
// so both versions are combined here into a single Student class.

    public $name;
    public $studentId;

// ---------- Part A demo ----------
// create an object just to test sayHello()

// ---------- Part C demo ----------

// Question: How many classes did you create?
// Answer: 1 class (Student)

// Question: How many objects did you create?
// Answer: 3 objects ($studentA, $student1, $student2)


// ==================== PART D — Access Modifiers ====================

class BankAccount {
    public $ownerName;
    private $balance;

    function __construct($ownerName, $balance) {
        $this->ownerName = $ownerName;
        $this->balance = $balance;
    }

    function showBalance() {
        echo "Balance: " . $this->balance . "<br>";
    }
}

$account1 = new BankAccount("Ahmad", 5000);

echo "Owner: " . $account1->ownerName . "<br>";
$account1->showBalance();

// Try This:
// echo $account1->balance;

// Question: Does it work?
// Answer: No

// Why?
// because $balance is private, so it can only be used inside the BankAccount
// class itself. outside code (like this echo line) is not allowed to touch it.
// that's why we made showBalance() - it is a safe way to show the balance
// from outside the class.


// ==================== PART E — Simple Inheritance ====================

class Person {
    public $name;

    function __construct($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    function introduce() {
        echo "My name is " . $this->name . "<br>";
    }
}

class StudentChild extends Person {
    // Note: renamed to StudentChild here because "Student" is already
    // used above by the Part A/B/C class. The lab originally calls it
    // "Student" but PHP does not allow the same class name twice.
    function study() {
        echo $this->name . " is studying.<br>";
    }
}

$student3 = new StudentChild("Ahmad");

$student3->introduce();
$student3->study();


// ==================== PART F — Understanding Inheritance ====================

// Question 1: Which class is the parent class?
// Answer: Person

// Question 2: Which class is the child class?
// Answer: Student (called StudentChild in this file to avoid a name conflict)

// Question 3: Which keyword creates the inheritance relationship?
// Answer: extends

// Question 4: The introduce() method was written inside which class?
// Answer: Person

// Question 5: Can the $student1 object call introduce()?
// Answer: Yes

// Question 6: Why can $student1 use introduce() even though it is not
// written inside the Student class?
// Answer: because Student extends Person, so Student inherits everything
// from Person, including the introduce() method. we don't need to write
// it again inside Student.


// ==================== PART G — Vehicle and Car ====================

class Vehicle {
    protected $brand;

    function __construct($brand) {
        $this->brand = $brand;

    }
